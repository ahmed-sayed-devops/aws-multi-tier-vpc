# üèó AWS Custom VPC for a Multi-Tier Web Application

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a *custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)* on AWS to host a *multi-tier web application*, using only the AWS Management Console.  
It's part of a beginner-level hands-on capstone project to apply AWS core services.

## üìê Architecture Overview

- Custom VPC with CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
- 2 Public Subnets: 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.20.0/24
- 2 Private Subnets: 10.0.100.0/24, 10.0.200.0/24
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- 2 NAT Gateways (each in a public subnet with EIP)
- 2 EC2 Instances (Web_Server1, Web_Server2) in Private Subnets
- IAM Role (ec2tossm) to allow SSM access
- Application Load Balancer (WebALB)
- Target Group (WebTG) with EC2 instances registered
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with Launch Template
- Security Groups (WebSG, ALBSG)

---

## üß± AWS Services Used

- Amazon VPC (with Subnets & Route Tables)
- Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
- Elastic IPs
- Amazon EC2 (t2.micro, Amazon Linux 2023)
- IAM Roles (for SSM access)
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM Session Manager)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Target Group & Health Checks
- Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template
- Security Groups

Load Balancer directing traffic to Web_Server2.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Target Group
![Target Group](./screenshots/23-web-TG-targets.png)  
Target Group with both web servers registered and healthy.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Template Creation
![Launch Template](./screenshots/24-template-created.png)  
Launch Template created for Auto Scaling Group.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling Group Details
![ASG Details](./screenshots/27-Auto-Scaling-Group-detailed.png)  
Auto Scaling Group configured with manual scaling options.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling Group Testing
![ASG Testing](./screenshots/28-Auto-Scaling-Group-testing.png)  
ASG scaled up to 4 instances as per desired capacity.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ ALB Final Browser Test
![ALB Final Test](./screenshots/29-ALB-browser-Final-testing.png)  
ALB serving content from auto-scaled instances with message:  
This is an app server in AWS Region US-EAST-1

---

## üåç Final Result

After the ALB and ASG setup, the application is served securely from private EC2 instances via the ALB.  
Scaling is automatic and traffic is balanced between instances.

## üîê Security Configuration Summary

| Security Group | Inbound | Outbound |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| *WebSG*      | HTTP 80 from ALBSG | Allow all |
| *ALBSG*      | HTTP 80 from Anywhere | HTTP to WebSG |

---

## üßπ Cleanup Steps

To avoid charges:
- Delete EC2 Instances and Auto Scaling Group
- Delete NAT Gateways and release Elastic IPs
- Delete ALB and Target Group
- Delete Internet Gateway and VPC
